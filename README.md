Design and implementation of a Enterprise-Grade Wireless Network with Strong Authentication

Security is one of the important aspect of todayâ€™s digital world. There have been numerous
breaches by people with malicious intent to either steal confidential data or disrupt daily activities
of a corporation. Security implemented at enterprise level still lack in certain design aspects
leading to said attacks. Existing security methods are often not implemented to account for various
threats and breaches. The most favored target is the end user as the highly vulnerable part of a
network is the human factor.
In the present day, poor implementation and design of enterprise networks leads to data
breaches and poor user security. Assumption that the network is secure after adding security at
layer 2 is an overlooked mistake. Due to having the option to randomize layer data on the user-
end for privacy, the layer 2 authentication methods such as MAC based authentication fail to serve
their purpose on their own. layer 3 authentication methods while still securing the user at layer 3
quite often ignore the layer 2 verification of the same user.
This project aims at a design, implementation and analysis of various enterprise security
and authentication methods to secure and maintain wireless users. We shall implement the security
methods to point out how they are flawed when used individually and provide a solution to those
issues by combining various authentication and encryption methods to make up for the said flaws.
